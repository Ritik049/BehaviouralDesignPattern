This lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class and make their objects interchangeable.

Suppose you build a navigation app for casual travelers.
One of most unique feature is route planning.
First version is build for roads which tells shortest path, but later we need another route that is on vacation , by build walking routes.

Strategy pattern suggests that you take a class that does something specific in a lot of different ways and extract all of these algorithms, into separate classes called strategies.

EXample for sorting we have different algorithms,

//Structure 
1)Strategy Interface --> void sort()
2)BubbleSort  --->Concrete Strategy
3)Quick Sort ---> Concrete Strategy
4)Sorting Context  --> Context class using a sorting Strategy
