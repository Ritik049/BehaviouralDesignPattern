It is a behavioural design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism , to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing.

This pattern allows for a  one-to-many dependency between objects, ensuring that all dependent objects are notified and updated automatically when the subject's state changes.


Structure:
1)subject
2)WeatherStation
3)Observor
4)Display
5)MobileApp
