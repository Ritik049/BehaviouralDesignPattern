This design patterns lets you add additional functionalities, without changing the object structure, without changing the classes of the elements themselves.
It allows you to separate the algorithm from the object structure on which it operates.

//Helps to code reuse and promote OCP

structure
1)Shape interface: void accept(Visitor visitor);
2)Circle implements shape: 
3)Square implements shape;
4)Visitor interface;
5)Areacalculator -->implements Visitor. 

Here in interface itself we use just only two implementation, or we can use if else also,  in concrete implementation
