# BehaviouralDesignPattern: These design pattern concerned with  algorithms and  the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

# Types:

#Chain Responsibility Design Pattern: It lets you pass requests along  a chain of handlers.Upon receiving a  request each handler decide it to either pass on to next handler or process it.

#Command Design Pattern: It turns the request  into stand alone object that contains all information about the request. This  transformation lets you pass the request as arguements, delay or queue the request execution, and support undoable operations.

#Iterator: Lets you traverse along the collection  without exposing its underlying representation(list,stack,tree etc)

#Mediator: Lets you reduce dependencies between objects, Instead of doing direct communication between object, force them to collaborate via mediator object.

#Momento: Lets you save the previous state of an object without revealing the details of implementation.

#Observor: Lets you define subscription mechanism by which if notifies all the objects about any events that happen to the object they are observing.

#State: Let an object alter its behaviour when its intternal state changes, it appears  as if the object changed its class

#Strategy: Lets you define algorithms, put each them into separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

#Template method: Defines skeleton of algorithm  in the superclass and lets subclass override specific steps  of the algorithm  without changing its structure.

#Visitor: It is a design pattern  that let you separate algorithms,from the object on which they operate.
